SlapORM
=======

This project meant to be an ORM for LDAP to be used with symfony 1.x.

It is now **DEPRECATED** and will not be updated anymore. If you are looking for a PHP Object Model Manager for LDAP, I suggest you have a look at [slapom](https://github.com/chanmix51/SlapOM "Small Object Model Manager for LDAP") that is by far more general, it can be used with any modern framework and has been tested against Active Directory and several thousands users.
